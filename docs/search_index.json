It is extremely difficult for people, especially the elders and children, to keep social distance and stay healthy during the pandemic if they live in a metropolitan area. Moreover, some neighborhoods are attacked by viruses more severely than others. Those neighborhoods might be composed of a large proportion of people who are much more susceptible to the viruses due to their health and living conditions. Therefore, the main purpose of our final project is to discover whether there exist a certain group of people or communities that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and how they respond to viruses. Moreover, we want to further investigate whether they experienced any other difficulties besides COVID-19 because other factors such as crime rates and air quality are equally important to their personal health and safety. We want to estimate the overall living condition across neighborhoods in New York City. Our goal is to help people make decisions on finding a healthy and safe place to live by analyzing data collected by multiple NYC departments. We will try to gain some insights from three different perspectives: COVID-19 cases and vaccination rate, crime rate, and air quality. After analyzing all these three perspectives, hopefully we may offer some advice on choosing the ideal neighborhood for people to live. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD We would like to carry out analysis from both geographic and time series perspectives to help people decide where to live in NYC and answer the following questions: ======= ## Potential Questions &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4421d7f29343801b2c0bea0ef3e605e7d38e31e0 Due to COVID-19, which neighborhoods or a certain group of people are severely attacked by viruses? Why are they different from other neighborhoods or people? What are the vaccination rates in different areas? What are the crime rates and most common crimes in different neighborhoods? What is the distribution of air quality data and how does air quality change in different neighborhoods and time? In the following chapters, we will analyze the datasets, discuss these questions and provide some interactive results. For more details of this project, please refer to ‘https://github.com/Elliot1h/NYCHouses’. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 COVID-19 Dataset 2.2 Crime Dataset 2.3 Air Quality Dataset", " Chapter 2 Data sources We obtain three main datasets from NYC Open Data. Open Data is free public data published by New York City agencies and other partners, which collects all kinds of data in NYC. In our project, we mainly consider about three types of datasets: COVID-19 datasets, which contain records of cases, deaths and vaccination populations; Crime datasets, which contain records of shooting, arrest and hate crime data in NYC; Air Quality dataset, which contains air quality data. We will try to gain some insights from the above three different perspectives. We want to estimate the overall living condition across neighborhoods in New York City. After analyzing all these three perspectives, hopefully we may offer some advice on choosing the ideal neighborhood for people to live. 2.1 COVID-19 Dataset 2.1.1 Daily Counts of Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths. Such dataset can be found on: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/COVID-19-Daily-Counts-of-Cases-Hospitalizations-an/rc75-m7u3 https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data Key variables: CASE_COUNT, HOSPITALIZED_COUNT, and DEATH_COUNT among various demographics aspects across various boroughs. 2.1.2 Vaccinated Population Data. Such dataset can be found on: https://github.com/nychealth/covid-vaccine-data/tree/main/people#coverage-summary-allagescsv Key variables: RACE_ETHNICITY, AGE_GROUP, COUNT_PARTIALLY_CUMULATIVE, COUNT_FULLY_CUMULATIVE, and COUNT_1PLUS_CUMULATIVE across BOROUGH. 2.2 Crime Dataset 2.2.1 Shooting Incident Data collected by NYPD. Such dataset can be found on: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8 https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Year-To-Date-/5ucz-vwe8 Key variables: PERP_AGE_GROUP, PERP_SEX, VIC_AGE_GROUP, VIC_SEX, and STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG across BORO at OCCUR_TIME. 2.2.2 Arrest Data collected by NYPD. Such dataset can be found on: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc Key variables: LAW_CODE, AGE_GROUP, PERP_SEX, and PERP_RACE across ARREST_BORO at Record Create Date. 2.2.3 Hate Crimes Data collected by NYPD. Such dataset can be found on: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Hate-Crimes/bqiq-cu78 Key variables: Law Code Category Description, Bias Motive Description, and Offense Description across County at ARREST_DATE. 2.3 Air Quality Dataset 2.3.1 New York City Air Quality Surveillance Data: This dataset contains information on New York City air quality surveillance data. Air pollution is one of the most important environmental threats to urban populations and while all people are exposed, pollutant emissions, levels of exposure, and population vulnerability vary across neighborhoods. Exposures to common air pollutants have been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and premature deaths. These indicators provide a perspective across time and NYC geographies to better characterize air quality and health in NYC. Air quality is an important indicator of living wellness. Analyzing air quality data will help us to find a health place for people to live. Air quality data contains these following key variables: Table 2.1: Key Variables in Air Quality Dataset Variable.name Description Name Name of the indicator Measure How the indicator is measured Geo Join ID Identifier of the neighborhood geographic area Start_Date Date value for the start of the time_period Data Value The actual data value for this indicator This dataset can be found on: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Air-Quality/c3uy-2p5r "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 COVID-19 Dataset 3.2 Crime Dataset 3.3 Air Quality Dataset", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 COVID-19 Dataset 3.2 Crime Dataset 3.3 Air Quality Dataset We first extracted the necessary columns that are mentioned in the previous chapter. Then we notice that in the Measure column, there are only two values, we only use Mean as out measure since there are not enough data for the other one. Table 3.1: Measure Counts Var1 Freq Mean 2397 million miles 321 In the Measure column, there are only three values. After counting the numbers of different values, we decide not to remove any values. Table 3.2: Measure Counts Var1 Freq Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) 987 Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) 987 Ozone (O3) 423 After removing some observations, we notice that in this data, there are hundreds of values in Neighborhood name columns, we need to use the Geo Join ID column to classify them into different boroughs. The Geo Join ID variable is the identifier of the neighborhood geographic area, which is a three or six digits number. The first digit represents different boroughs. From the histogram above we can see that after classification, the dataset seems to be pretty balanced. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Our Analysis 4.2 Crime Dataset", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Our Analysis Since there are no missing values in air quality dataset and Covid-19 dataset. We will investigate how missing values appear in three crime-related datasets in this part. 4.2 Crime Dataset 4.2.1 Shooting Incident Data The first dataset contains every shooting incident that occurred in NYC from 2020 to this date. This is a breakdown of every shooting incident that occurred in NYC. Each record represents a shooting incident in NYC and includes information about the event, the location and time of occurrence. In addition, information related to suspect and victim demographics is also included. ## LOCATION_DESC PERP_RACE PERP_AGE_GROUP ## 2265 1995 1966 ## PERP_SEX VIC_AGE_GROUP VIC_RACE ## 1965 10 10 ## BORO OCCUR_DATE OCCUR_TIME ## 0 0 0 ## PRECINCT STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG VIC_SEX ## 0 0 0 We first replace the “” and “UNKNOWN” with NA in the dataset and then count the number of missing values by column. LOCATION_DESC column has the greatest number of missing values. Such column tells us the location of the shooting incident. PERP_RACE, PERP_AGE_GROUP, and PERP_SEX also have a great amount of missing values and their NA counts are very close to each other. Next, we draw a missing plot for all variables and missing patterns. From the plot we can observe there are 15 different patterns. Variables LOCATION_DESC, PERP_RACE, PERP_AGE_GROUP, and PERP_SEX have more than 50% missing rates, while other variables have almost no missing values. Those four variables are the most common missing pattern. Only about 10% of all rows are recored as complete for all variables that we are interested in. The reason behind this maybe that in most cases perpetrator are not arrested, thus all related information is missing even though other information is documented by police. With respect to shooting crimes, it is difficult for the police to identify the perpetrators. 4.2.2 Arrest Data The second dataset contains every arrest effected in NYC by the NYPD from 2020 to this date. Each record represents an arrest effected in NYC by the NYPD and includes information about the type of crime, the location and time of enforcement. In addition, information related to suspect demographics is also included. ## LAW_CAT_CD PERP_RACE KY_CD OFNS_DESC PD_DESC ## 2467 1084 98 98 98 ## PD_CD AGE_GROUP ARREST_BORO ARREST_DATE ARREST_PRECINCT ## 44 0 0 0 0 ## LAW_CODE PERP_SEX ## 0 0 We follow the same procedure as above to first count the number of missing values by column. We observe variable LAW_CAT_CD has the greatest number of missing values and it is almost 2 times greater than PERP_RACE’s number of NAs. After drawing a missing plot for all variables and missing patterns, we find that even though variables PERP_RACE, KY_CD, OFNS_DESC, and PD_DESC have some missing values the portion of those missing data is very small if compared with the whole dataset. Moreover, the other variables have almost no missing values. The most common pattern is complete case, which suggests that the police manage to collect comprehensive detailed information for an arrest. 4.2.3 Hate Crimes Data The last dataset is about confirmed hate crime incidents in New York City. Each record represents hate crimes reported in NYC by the NYPD and includes information about the description, the location and time of enforcement. In addition, information related to suspect demographics is also included. ## Full.Complaint.ID Complaint.Year.Number ## 0 0 ## Month.Number Record.Create.Date ## 0 0 ## Complaint.Precinct.Code Patrol.Borough.Name ## 0 0 ## County Law.Code.Category.Description ## 0 0 ## Offense.Description PD.Code.Description ## 0 0 ## Bias.Motive.Description Offense.Category ## 0 0 ## Arrest.Date ## 0 We count the number of missing values by column and draw a missing plot for all variables and missing patterns. We discover that the dataset is much relatively smaller than the previous datasets and contains no missing values. All hate crimes data are complete. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 COVID-19 Dataset 5.2 Crime Dataset 5.3 Air Quality Dataset", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 COVID-19 Dataset 5.2 Crime Dataset 5.3 Air Quality Dataset There are three different measures of air quality: Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Ozone (O3). In this part, we draw three boxplots and three lineplots to visualize how these three kinds of data distribute in different boroughs and how they change over the time. First, we choose PM2.5 to draw the plot, which is the most common indicator for air quality. From the plot we can observe that Manhattan and Bronx have the highest mean PM 2.5 value , while Staten Island has a better air quality. Manhattan’s PM 2.5 value also varies the most. Besides, Bronx has the most outliers which indicates that there are some places are heavily polluted. The reason behind this might be that Manhattan and Bronx have higher population and less land, which could result in more toxic waste in air. From the lineplot we can also observe that PM 2.5 in air quality is periodical, which is usually lower in the begining of a year. We can also conclude that for all boroughs, the air quality is getting better and better from 2016 to 2018 as the values are descending. In the second graph, we use a different measure NO2, and the results are basically the same with the last one depite that Bronx is the leading polluted borough in this measure. From the lineplot we can also observe that NO2 in air quality is also periodical. One difference from the above one is that the NO2 is usually lower in the middle of a year and peaks in the end of the year. We can also conclude that for all boroughs, the air quality is getting better and better from 2016 to 2018 as the values are descending. Ozone (O3) has become the most dangerous toxic air particles in recent years, which could do serious damage to human lungs. In the third graph, we visualize how O3 data distributed in different boroughs. The results are very different from the last two. Queens becomes the most polluted borough with most outliers. While Mahanttan and Bronx who have most NO2 and PM 2.5 have least O3 in air. We could not find a reason for this observation. However, what we can be sure is that we should use different measures to indicate how air is polluted since different particles may not have the same distributions in boroughs. The lineplot does not show much information since there are not enough data. We can not be sure if O3 in air quality is also periodical. However, we can observe that for all boroughs, the air quality is first getting better and then getting worse from 2016 to 2018 when considering O3 values. And we should be more careful about O3.

Due to time limit, we only create the interactive component for air quality dataset in NYC.The date we use are from NYC open data as described in previous sections, but formats of certain columns were changed to adapt to the plot. You can find the data here under the data folder of our repo. 6.3 Instructions for using the map The plot is initialized with a histogram of mean PM 2.5 values in different boroughs. Users can press the bottons below the graph, you can see the mean NO2 and O3 values for different boroughs. Users can hover the mouse over a bar to see the difference between values for this borough and other boroughs.
