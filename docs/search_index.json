[["index.html", "Tenants’ Guidebook to New York City Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Potential Questions", " Tenants’ Guidebook to New York City Yunze Pan (yp2599), Xinyu Huang (xh2511) 2021-12-14 Chapter 1 Introduction According to research by NYC Health, more than one million New York residents have been impacted by COVID-19. It is extremely difficult for people, especially the elders and children, to keep social distance and stay healthy during the pandemic if they live in a metropolitan area. Moreover, some neighborhoods are attacked by viruses more severely than others. Those neighborhoods might be composed of a large proportion of people who are much more susceptible to the viruses due to their health and living conditions. Therefore, the main purpose of our final project is to discover whether there exist a certain group of people or communities that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and how they respond to viruses. Moreover, we want to further investigate whether they experienced any other difficulties besides COVID-19 because other factors such as crime rates and air quality are equally important to their personal health and safety. We want to estimate the overall living condition across neighborhoods in New York City. Our goal is to help people make decisions on finding a healthy and safe place to live by analyzing data collected by multiple NYC departments. We will try to gain some insights from three different perspectives: COVID-19 cases and vaccination rate, crime rate, and air quality. After analyzing all these three perspectives, hopefully we may offer some advice on choosing the ideal neighborhood for people to live. We would like to carry out analysis from both geographic and time series perspectives to help people decide where to live in NYC and answer the following questions: 1.1 Potential Questions To cope with COVID-19 pandemic, which area have the highest vaccination rates ? And what are the rates for different age groups and ethnicities. What are the crime rates and most common crimes in different neighborhoods? What is the distribution of air quality data and how does air quality change in different neighborhoods and time? In the following chapters, we will analyze the datasets, discuss these questions and provide some interactive results. For more details of this project, please refer to ‘https://github.com/Elliot1h/NYCHouses’. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 COVID-19 Dataset 2.2 Crime Dataset 2.3 Air Quality Dataset", " Chapter 2 Data sources We obtain three main datasets from NYC Open Data. Open Data is free public data published by New York City agencies and other partners, which collects all kinds of data in NYC. In our project, we mainly consider about three types of datasets: COVID-19 datasets, which contain records of cases, deaths and vaccination populations; Crime datasets, which contain records of shooting, arrest and hate crime data in NYC; Air Quality dataset, which contains air quality data. We will try to gain some insights from the above three different perspectives. We want to estimate the overall living condition across neighborhoods in New York City. After analyzing all these three perspectives, hopefully we may offer some advice on choosing the ideal neighborhood for people to live. 2.1 COVID-19 Dataset 2.1.1 Vaccinated Population Data. These data show the percent of NYC residents who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and the percent who are fully vaccinated, by borough of residence and demographic group. The percentages reflect the number of people vaccinated within that specific demographic group. Vaccination rates are reported by standard U.S Census age categories. The population estimate available for youth eligible for vaccination is among ages 5 to 17. Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent COVID infection. With higher vaccination rate, community immunity will be more likely to be achieved. Thus if you want to find a place in new york, the vaccination rate can be taken into considerations. These indicators provide a perspective across time and NYC geographies to better characterize health in NYC. Vaccinated Population data contains these following key variables: Table 2.1: Key Variables in Air Quality Dataset Variable.name Description BOROUGH Borough of residence AGE_GROUP Race/ethnicity group RACE_ETHNICITY Age group in years PERC_FULLY Estimated percentage of people fully vaccinated PERC_1PLUS Estimated percentage of people vaccinated This dataset can be found on: https://github.com/nychealth/covid-vaccine-data/tree/main/people#coverage-summary-allagescsv 2.2 Crime Dataset 2.2.1 Shooting Incident Data collected by NYPD. List of every shooting incident that occurred in NYC going back to 2006 through the end of the previous calendar year. This is a breakdown of every shooting incident that occurred in NYC going back to 2006 through the end of the previous calendar year. This data is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning before being posted on the NYPD website. Each record represents a shooting incident in NYC and includes information about the event, the location and time of occurrence. In addition, information related to suspect and victim demographics is also included. This data can be used by the public to explore the nature of shooting/criminal activity. The datasets we need can be found on: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8 https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Year-To-Date-/5ucz-vwe8 Key variables: PERP_AGE_GROUP, PERP_SEX, VIC_AGE_GROUP, VIC_SEX, and STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG across BORO at OCCUR_TIME. 2.2.2 Arrest Data collected by NYPD. The dataset consists of list of every arrest in NYC going back to 2006 through the end of the previous calendar year. This is a breakdown of every arrest effected in NYC by the NYPD going back to 2006 through the end of the previous calendar year. This data is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning before being posted on the NYPD website. Each record represents an arrest effected in NYC by the NYPD and includes information about the type of crime, the location and time of enforcement. In addition, information related to suspect demographics is also included. This dataset can be found on: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc Key variables: LAW_CODE, AGE_GROUP, PERP_SEX, and PERP_RACE across ARREST_BORO at Record Create Date. 2.3 Air Quality Dataset 2.3.1 New York City Air Quality Surveillance Data: This dataset contains information on New York City air quality surveillance data. Air pollution is one of the most important environmental threats to urban populations and while all people are exposed, pollutant emissions, levels of exposure, and population vulnerability vary across neighborhoods. Exposures to common air pollutants have been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and premature deaths. These indicators provide a perspective across time and NYC geographies to better characterize air quality and health in NYC. Air quality is an important indicator of living wellness. Analyzing air quality data will help us to find a health place for people to live. Air quality data contains these following key variables: Table 2.2: Key Variables in Air Quality Dataset Variable.name Description Name Name of the indicator Measure How the indicator is measured Geo Join ID Identifier of the neighborhood geographic area Start_Date Date value for the start of the time_period Data Value The actual data value for this indicator This dataset can be found on: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Air-Quality/c3uy-2p5r "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 COVID-19 Dataset 3.2 Crime Dataset 3.3 Air Quality Dataset", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Initially the two datasets were imported and combined into a single data frame. The single dataframe now consisted of shooting data provided by the NYPD over the years 2006 to 2019. As we are evaluating on neighborhoods it is necessary to find out what neighborhood each event corresponds to. Unfortunately, unlike the other two datasets the zip code was not provided and the only information given was the longitude and latitude data. Using python packages we were able to retrieve the zip code information using longitude and latitude data. After the zip codes were added in a new column ‘Zip’ the file was exported as NYPD_ZIP.csv. The below is the python code we used. As a result, we have decided to utilize a reduced version of this dataset that only includes data starting in 2011. For a lot of our analysis we will want a combined dataset, so we can append the historical data to the 2021 data like so: In this dataset, many columns are pre-processed by the authors, so our work is to choose the variables we need and change the names and orders of factor levels. We cleaned the dataset in the following steps: Select AppStore, PriceSensitive, WhyDownload, Currency &amp; demographic columns (Gender, Age, Nationality, Education, Occupation, etc.) Mutate character variables to factors Rename the levels with readable information Reorder the levels for future visualization In this section, we are going to load our dataset and clean it. There are five main steps to transform the dataset: 1) download the csv files from the NYCD OpenData and extract data only from a specific time interval, 2) continue to select a proportion of variables to avoid unnecessary data, 3) detect the missing values in the dataset and replace them with “NA”, 4) add or remove some variables that may be helpful to conduct our analyses, and 5) change the orders of factor levels or some character’s names so that they can be easily understood. We combine sub-datasets into on dataset as a whole. For example, after we add the information of years in different sub datasets, we will combine these data sets into one dataset that contains information of all of these years. For some NAs that still exists, we fill them by the group averages within combined datasets. We do calculations based on the existed variables to get other variables that we want add them as new columns. 3.1 COVID-19 Dataset This file contains information on the number and estimated percentage of NYC residents fully vaccinated and residents who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine by Modified ZCTA (MODZCTA). Percentages of NYC residents vaccinated is calculated against the estimated total population of the specified MODZCTA. Note that the number of people vaccinated may exceed the estimated population and lead to more than 100% vaccination coverage, especially for smaller demographic categories and geographies. Since the dataset provided is already clean, we only need to extracted the necessary columns that are mentioned in the previous chapter. 3.2 Crime Dataset 3.2.1 Shooting Incident Data After downloading the csv file from the website, we combine the NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic) and the NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Year to Date). Since we are more confused on people’s living condition in New York city during the pandemic, we only select data from 2020-01-01 to 2021-09-30 and export it a csv file. We consider BORO, LOCATION_DESC, OCCUR_DATE, OCCUR_TIME, STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG, VIC_AGE_GROUP, VIC_RACE, and VIC_SEX as important variables and remove the remaining variables. We also change each name for the BORO column to make it more readable. ## BORO LOCATION_DESC OCCUR_DATE ## Length:3473 Length:3473 Length:3473 ## Class :character Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character ## ## OCCUR_TIME STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG VIC_AGE_GROUP ## Length:3473 Mode :logical Length:3473 ## Class1:hms FALSE:2799 Class :character ## Class2:difftime TRUE :674 Mode :character ## Mode :numeric ## VIC_RACE VIC_SEX ## Length:3473 Length:3473 ## Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character ## ## # A tibble: 6 × 8 ## BORO LOCATION_DESC OCCUR_DATE OCCUR_TIME STATISTICAL_MURDER… ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;time&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 Brooklyn &lt;NA&gt; 1/1/20 02:35 FALSE ## 2 Bronx MULTI DWELL - PUBL… 1/1/20 10:29 TRUE ## 3 Bronx MULTI DWELL - PUBL… 1/1/20 10:29 TRUE ## 4 Manhattan &lt;NA&gt; 1/1/20 21:47 TRUE ## 5 Brooklyn &lt;NA&gt; 1/2/20 04:10 FALSE ## 6 Manhattan MULTI DWELL - PUBL… 1/2/20 16:25 FALSE ## # … with 3 more variables: VIC_AGE_GROUP &lt;chr&gt;, VIC_RACE &lt;chr&gt;, ## # VIC_SEX &lt;chr&gt; 3.2.2 Arrest Data We follow the similar steps as shown before by combining the NYPD Arrest Data Data (Historic) and the NYPD Arrest Data Data (Year to Date). We only select data from 2020-01-01 to 2021-09-30 to keep it consistent with the shooting incident dataset and export it a csv file. We consider ARREST_BORO, ARREST_DATE, LAW_CAT_CD, OFNS_DESC, and PD_DESC as important variables. We also add three new variables ArrestYear, ARREST_MONTH, and ARREST_WEEKDAY. ## ARREST_BORO ARREST_DATE LAW_CAT_CD ## Length:255712 Min. :2020-01-01 Length:255712 ## Class :character 1st Qu.:2020-05-26 Class :character ## Mode :character Median :2020-11-30 Mode :character ## Mean :2020-11-18 ## 3rd Qu.:2021-05-06 ## Max. :2021-09-30 ## OFNS_DESC PD_DESC ArrestYear ARREST_MONTH ## Length:255712 Length:255712 2020:140413 Min. : 1.000 ## Class :character Class :character 2021:115299 1st Qu.: 3.000 ## Mode :character Mode :character Median : 5.000 ## Mean : 5.714 ## 3rd Qu.: 8.000 ## Max. :12.000 ## ARREST_WEEKDAY ## Length:255712 ## Class :character ## Mode :character ## ## ## ## # A tibble: 6 × 8 ## ARREST_BORO ARREST_DATE LAW_CAT_CD OFNS_DESC PD_DESC ArrestYear ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 Brooklyn 2020-01-01 Felony ROBBERY ROBBERY,O… 2020 ## 2 Bronx 2020-01-01 Misdemeanor DANGEROUS WE… WEAPONS, … 2020 ## 3 Bronx 2020-01-01 Misdemeanor ASSAULT 3 &amp; … OBSTR BRE… 2020 ## 4 Brooklyn 2020-01-01 Misdemeanor POSSESSION O… STOLEN PR… 2020 ## 5 Brooklyn 2020-01-01 Felony MISCELLANEOU… PUBLIC AD… 2020 ## 6 Queens 2020-01-01 Misdemeanor INTOXICATED … INTOXICAT… 2020 ## # … with 2 more variables: ARREST_MONTH &lt;dbl&gt;, ARREST_WEEKDAY &lt;chr&gt; 3.3 Air Quality Dataset We first extracted the necessary columns that are mentioned in the previous chapter. Then we notice that in the Measure column, there are only two values, we only use Mean as out measure since there are not enough data for the other one. Table 3.1: Measure Counts Var1 Freq Mean 2397 million miles 321 In the Measure column, there are only three values. After counting the numbers of different values, we decide not to remove any values. Table 3.2: Measure Counts Var1 Freq Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) 987 Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) 987 Ozone (O3) 423 After removing some observations, we notice that in this data, there are hundreds of values in Neighborhood name columns, we need to use the Geo Join ID column to classify them into different boroughs. The Geo Join ID variable is the identifier of the neighborhood geographic area, which is a three or six digits number. The first digit represents different boroughs. From the histogram above we can see that after classification, the dataset seems to be pretty balanced. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Our Analysis 4.2 Crime Dataset", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Our Analysis Since there are no missing values in air quality dataset and Covid-19 dataset. We will investigate how missing values appear in three crime-related datasets in this part. 4.2 Crime Dataset 4.2.1 Shooting Incident Data The first dataset contains every shooting incident that occurred in NYC from 2020 to this date. This is a breakdown of every shooting incident that occurred in NYC. Each record represents a shooting incident in NYC and includes information about the event, the location and time of occurrence. In addition, information related to suspect and victim demographics is also included. ## LOCATION_DESC PERP_RACE PERP_AGE_GROUP ## 2265 1995 1966 ## PERP_SEX VIC_AGE_GROUP VIC_RACE ## 1965 10 10 ## BORO OCCUR_DATE OCCUR_TIME ## 0 0 0 ## PRECINCT STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG VIC_SEX ## 0 0 0 We first replace the “” and “UNKNOWN” with NA in the dataset and then count the number of missing values by column. LOCATION_DESC column has the greatest number of missing values. Such column tells us the location of the shooting incident. PERP_RACE, PERP_AGE_GROUP, and PERP_SEX also have a great amount of missing values and their NA counts are very close to each other. Next, we draw a missing plot for all variables and missing patterns. From the plot we can observe there are 15 different patterns. Variables LOCATION_DESC, PERP_RACE, PERP_AGE_GROUP, and PERP_SEX have more than 50% missing rates, while other variables have almost no missing values. Those four variables are the most common missing pattern. Only about 10% of all rows are recored as complete for all variables that we are interested in. The reason behind this maybe that in most cases perpetrator are not arrested, thus all related information is missing even though other information is documented by police. With respect to shooting crimes, it is difficult for the police to identify the perpetrators. 4.2.2 Arrest Data The second dataset contains every arrest effected in NYC by the NYPD from 2020 to this date. Each record represents an arrest effected in NYC by the NYPD and includes information about the type of crime, the location and time of enforcement. In addition, information related to suspect demographics is also included. ## LAW_CAT_CD PERP_RACE KY_CD OFNS_DESC ## 2467 1084 98 98 ## PD_DESC PD_CD AGE_GROUP ARREST_BORO ## 98 44 0 0 ## ARREST_DATE ARREST_PRECINCT LAW_CODE PERP_SEX ## 0 0 0 0 We follow the same procedure as above to first count the number of missing values by column. We observe variable LAW_CAT_CD has the greatest number of missing values and it is almost 2 times greater than PERP_RACE’s number of NAs. After drawing a missing plot for all variables and missing patterns, we find that even though variables PERP_RACE, KY_CD, OFNS_DESC, and PD_DESC have some missing values the portion of those missing data is very small if compared with the whole dataset. Moreover, the other variables have almost no missing values. The most common pattern is complete case, which suggests that the police manage to collect comprehensive detailed information for an arrest. 4.2.3 Hate Crimes Data The last dataset is about confirmed hate crime incidents in New York City. Each record represents hate crimes reported in NYC by the NYPD and includes information about the description, the location and time of enforcement. In addition, information related to suspect demographics is also included. ## Full.Complaint.ID Complaint.Year.Number ## 0 0 ## Month.Number Record.Create.Date ## 0 0 ## Complaint.Precinct.Code Patrol.Borough.Name ## 0 0 ## County Law.Code.Category.Description ## 0 0 ## Offense.Description PD.Code.Description ## 0 0 ## Bias.Motive.Description Offense.Category ## 0 0 ## Arrest.Date ## 0 We count the number of missing values by column and draw a missing plot for all variables and missing patterns. We discover that the dataset is much relatively smaller than the previous datasets and contains no missing values. All hate crimes data are complete. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 COVID-19 Dataset 5.2 Crime Dataset 5.3 Air Quality Dataset", " Chapter 5 Results In this section, we will present our results by using various visualization techniques to evaluate the overall living condition across neighborhoods in New York City. We think the findings we discover will help people make a better decision to to maintain a safe and healthy life. 5.1 COVID-19 Dataset We will draw two headmaps to visualize what are the vaccination rate in different ages, ethnicities in different boroughs and citywide. From the above plot we can observe percentage of people fully vaccinated in different ages, ethnicities in different boroughs and citywide. For different age groups, teenagers and adults have the highest vaccination rate since most of them are required to do so. While kids have lower rates than any other group because some vaccines are not suitable for kids. For ethnicity, Asian people seem to be more willingly to be vaccinated. While others are basically the same. For boroughs, Manhattan has the highest vaccination rate for most age groups and ethnicities. The reason behind this might be that Manhattan have more regulations for vaccinations and have higher population density. While in low population density area like Staten Island, people may not be so eager to get vaccinated. From the above plot we can observe percentage of people vaccinated in different ages, ethnicities in different boroughs and citywide. The results do not change a lot from the last one. Teenagers and adults still have the highest vaccination rate and Manhattan has the highest vaccination rate for most age groups and ethnicities. One interesting fact is that the rate is much higher than rate for fully vaccinated people. An explanation may be that NYC only offer 100$ bonus for the first dose and many people do not think it is necessary to get a second dose. 5.2 Crime Dataset 5.2.1 Shooting Incident Data We try to take a look at the trend of the shooting incidents across Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island boroughs since 2020-01-01. The intuition is that we want to discover whether shooting incidents decrease during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions and Business Closures. However, the truth is the gun violence epidemic has surged since the pandemic started. As we can see from the plot, the number of shooting incidents for all five boroughs in New York City all reached the peak value since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2020, the number of shooting incidents occurred in Brooklyn in July 2020 is 165, which is 135% greater than the second largest number of shooting incidents occurred in Bronx. Even though the majority of people are forced to stay home, gun violence spikes during the summer of 2020. One possible explanation could be that the prolonged emotional and financial stress may lead to the indoor violence. According to Gun Violence Archive, there is a 25 percent increase in deaths related to gun homicides and non-suicide-related shootings from 2019. It seems like less shooting incidents happened during the winter holiday for five boroughs. Compared with Brooklyn and Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island have a relatively smaller number of gun violence incidents. When looking at the location of where shooting incidents happened, we create a multidot Cleveland dot plot to display the 30 most frequent places and show the counts for Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island boroughs for each of these 30 places. Surprisingly, for each borough, a great proportion of location descriptions about the shooting incidents are missing. For example, the police can not determine over 700 shooting incidents in Brooklyn and over 250 cases’ locations in Manhattan are unknown or missing. From the plot, we can also see that multi-dwell public houses and apartment buildings are the places where the shooting took place most often. Such findings can somewhat support the evidence that gun violence surged during the pandemic as we just discussed. Next we will try to explore the time that shooting incidents took place most frequently. Therefore, we use a square heatmap to help us identify some interesting pattern based on the time of the shooting incidents. We first need to aggregate data by day and hour. For example, an incident occurred on 2020-04-08 16:35:00. Then, such data point has a x coordinate equal to 16 and a y coordinate equal to 8. After accumulating all shooting incidents, we can distinguish which hour in a day or which day in a month appears to be the most dangerous period of time to commute in the city. The heat map reveals that fewer shooting incidents happened between 5:00 AM and 10:00 AM if compared with other time slots. Clearly, many shooting incidents took place around midnight. We also find a very dark square in the plot which is located at (03, 13), implying that there might be a surge in gun violence on a specific day. Besides, we draw a mosaic pairs plot of all categorical (factor) variables related to victims’ demographics. For example, BORO variable could tell us the place victims visited. STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG variable could tell us whether the victim was dead. Other three variables give us more info about the victim’s demographics. Not surprisingly, Brooklyn and Bronx have more gun violence instances. Around 20% of victims are dead. Most of victims are 25-44 years old, African American, and male. Based on the plot, borough (variable BORO) and victim’s race (variable VIC_RACE) seem to have a strong association. Compared with other boroughs, a victim’s race is more likely to be African American and less likely to be White when the shooting incident happened in Brooklyn. Any pair of variables that consist of gender (variable VIC_SEX) has a weak association. 5.2.2 Arrest Data How about the trend of arrests across five boroughs in New York city since 2020-01-01? We want to investigate whether the number of arrests have a similar pattern as the number of shooting incidents. It is worth noting that the overall number of arrests is way larger than the overall number of shooting incidents. Brooklyn and Manhattan are the two boroughs that have a very large number of arrests. Staten island has the least number of arrests throughout the year. Except for Staten island, we find other four boroughs have very similar distributions. In January, February and March, four boroughs have their top 3 greatest number of arrests in a year respectively. A small surge can be observed in May for four boroughs. Moreover, we can see a big gap between September and October and fewer arrests were recorded in winter holiday, which follows a same trend that we have observed in our shooting incident dataset. We also plot a histogram to display the number of arrests in different years across Brooklyn, Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island boroughs. We try to find whether the policy that aimed at reducing the crowd during the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on reducing number of arrests in New York city. As we can see, there exist two sharp decreases. One occurred after March 2020 and the other one occurred after May 2020. However, as business began to reopen and citizens in New York city became to get back normal starting in Spring 2021, the number of arrests was rising. Across five boroughs in New York city, the number of arrests in 2021 exceeded last year since the beginning of March 2021. Another interesting finding is that arrests usually happen during the middle of the week. The number of arrests gradually increases until it reaches the maximum on Wednesday and then decreases. One possible explanation is that fewer police on the street during the weekends. We also want to track types of arrests. By displaying the bar plot, we find the most common type of arrest is misdemeanor with 117856 counts. Felony has the second largest count which is 134219. The least common type of arrest is infraction with 351 counts. Since violations and in fractions appear to be less common in our dataset, we will only discover the association between type of arrest such as felony and misdemeanor and other variables like boroughs as well as days in a week. According to the NYPD, misdemeanors are considered to be crimes that are not as serious as felonies. As a result, we are more concerned with arrests that are related to felonies. From the mosaic plot, we find there is an association between type of arrest and day in a week. Across five boroughs, number of arrests that are felonies is relatively smaller on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Moreover, there is an association between type of arrest and location. Brooklyn and Queens have relatively a larger number of arrests that are felonies. We also want to look at the most common offense type by creating a multidot Cleveland dot plot to display the 30 most frequent offense types and show the counts for Brooklyn, Manhattan, Bronx, Queens and Staten Island boroughs for each of these 30 offense types. We can see that for each offense type Brooklyn and Manhattan have largest counts among five boroughs while Staten island always has the smallest counts. 5.3 Air Quality Dataset There are three different measures of air quality: Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Ozone (O3). In this part, we draw three boxplots and three lineplots to visualize how these three kinds of data distribute in different boroughs and how they change over the time. First, we choose PM2.5 to draw the plot, which is the most common indicator for air quality. From the plot we can observe that Manhattan and Bronx have the highest mean PM 2.5 value , while Staten Island has a better air quality. Manhattan’s PM 2.5 value also varies the most. Besides, Bronx has the most outliers which indicates that there are some places are heavily polluted. The reason behind this might be that Manhattan and Bronx have higher population and less land, which could result in more toxic waste in air. From the lineplot we can also observe that PM 2.5 in air quality is periodical, which is usually lower in the begining of a year. We can also conclude that for all boroughs, the air quality is getting better and better from 2016 to 2018 as the values are descending. In the second graph, we use a different measure NO2, and the results are basically the same with the last one depite that Bronx is the leading polluted borough in this measure. From the lineplot we can also observe that NO2 in air quality is also periodical. One difference from the above one is that the NO2 is usually lower in the middle of a year and peaks in the end of the year. We can also conclude that for all boroughs, the air quality is getting better and better from 2016 to 2018 as the values are descending. Ozone (O3) has become the most dangerous toxic air particles in recent years, which could do serious damage to human lungs. In the third graph, we visualize how O3 data distributed in different boroughs. The results are very different from the last two. Queens becomes the most polluted borough with most outliers. While Mahanttan and Bronx who have most NO2 and PM 2.5 have least O3 in air. We could not find a reason for this observation. However, what we can be sure is that we should use different measures to indicate how air is polluted since different particles may not have the same distributions in boroughs. The lineplot does not show much information since there are not enough data. We can not be sure if O3 in air quality is also periodical. However, we can observe that for all boroughs, the air quality is first getting better and then getting worse from 2016 to 2018 when considering O3 values. And we should be more careful about O3.

After analyzing these datasets, we gain some insights from the above three different perspectives. We will answer the questions we give in th begining and offer some advice on choosing the ideal neighborhood for people to live. For the first question, we analyze the dataset and get the conclusion that Manhattan has the highest vaccination rate for most age groups and ethnicities. The reason behind this might be that Manhattan have more regulations for vaccinations and have higher population density. While in low population density area like Staten Island, people may not be so eager to get vaccinated. Besides that, we also observe that teenagers and adults have the highest vaccination rate and Asian people seem to be more willingly to be vaccinated. For the second question, The gun violence has surged since the pandemic started, especially in Brooklyn and Bronx.We find fewer shooting incidents happened between 5:00 AM and 10:00 AM while more shooting incidents took place around midnight. Moreover, communities and shooting incident victim’s demographics have a strong association. According to the arrest dataset,the overall number of arrests is much larger than the overall number of shooting incidents. Brooklyn and Manhattan are the two boroughs that have a very large number of arrests. Most importantly, the number of arrests was rising since Spring 2021. Across five boroughs in New York city, the number of arrests in 2021 exceeded last year since the beginning of March 2021. Another interesting finding is that arrests usually happen during the middle of the week. And there is an association between type of arrest and day in a week. Finally, we can see that for each offense type Brooklyn and Manhattan have largest counts among five boroughs while Staten island always has the smallest counts. We will also investigate the hate crimes dataset in the future to help you have a better understanding of crime rates in boroughs in New York City. For the third question. We may conclude that for PM 2.5 and NO2, Manhattan and Bronx have the highest mean value , while Staten Island has a better air quality. PM 2.5 and NO2 in air quality is periodical, which is usually lower in the begining of a year. We can also conclude that for all boroughs, the air quality is getting better and better from 2016 to 2018 as the values are descending. For O3, Queens becomes the most polluted borough with most outliers. While Mahanttan and Bronx who have most NO2 and PM 2.5 have least O3 in air. In conclusion, if you are going to find a place to live in New York City, Manhattan is a probably a good choice. "]]
